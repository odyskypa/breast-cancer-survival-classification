## Instructions for Executing Analysis Notebooks

* Include in a single folder the files `01.EDA-feature-extraction.ipynb`, `02.Modeling.ipynb` and `Breast_Cancer.csv` included in the repository.
* Execute the notebooks with the following order:
	* `01.EDA-feature-extraction.ipynb`
		* This notebook generates in the end the updated dataset, which includes all the changes introduced during the EDA.
		* The name of the updated dataset is set to be `breast_cancer_new.csv`. This file is being used from the second notebook in order to complete the modeling part.
	* `02.Modeling.ipynb`
* Both notebooks generate some extra csv files, containing information used during the analysis
	* E.g.: `chi-2.csv` and `chi-2-2.csv` files mentioned in the report are generated during the execution of the above-mentioned notebooks. They can also be found in this repository.
* Uncomment the first cell of the notebooks in order to install missing libraries.
* Click on the `Run all` button of the notebooks to reproduce the results of the whole project.
